 if your offline, copy the the server, unzip and run .\setupwacinstall.  
 
0.	Option 0- Required - All prerequsites for the product to work. - Run on one Cluster node and WAC machine
1.	Option 1 Required - Clears files and old installs. Run on one node and on the WAC server.
2.	Option 2 Required - Install ISM module. Run on one node and all nodes are addressed. Run on one node and on the WAC server.
3.	Option 3 Required - Checks many failure points. run on each node- or on suspect nodes only
4.	Option 4 Required - Install WAC on Wac server. Do not run on Cluster node
     a.	Install OMIMSWAC extension using gear tab (you will need to install manually using gear icon, choose extensions)
5. Final Steps for setup


     a. Use cluster manager to deploy CAU. 
     
          1. Before you do, go to ADUC and create a computer account in the same OU as the cluster nodes
          2. Once Created go to the OU above and right click ->properties-> security tab-click add -> change object type to computer
          3. add the Computer name just created. and add the rights to write computer ojects 
          4. Read/Write computer ojbects, Read/Write child objects, Read and write.
          5. make sure the cluster is also in this OU and has full control over the cluster nodes
          6. reference https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/failover-clustering/prestage-cluster-adds
        
     b. Create a share - not in the cluster or vms on cluster- all nodes need full control to this folder. 
     
          1. Main share \\Servername
          2. DEllUpdates - Folder where all the OMIMSWAC files will be located \\Servername\Folder
          3. DSU - Dell Server Update EXE- Place in this folder - \\Servername\DEllUpdatesDSU\
                   (i) Download DSU from  https://dl.dell.com/omimswac/ 
                   (ii) path will later be used by OMIMSWAC  \\Servername\DEllUpdates\DSU\Systems-Management_Application_5C2CW_WN64_1.9.2.0_A00.EXE
          4. IC Inventory COllector. place in the path created -  \\Servername\DEllUpdates\IC\
                   (i) Download from  Download https://dl.dell.com/omimswac/ 
                   (ii) path will later be used by OMIMSWAC  - \\Servername\DEllUpdates\IC\invcol_8YPK7_WIN64_21_12_200_1196_A00.exe
                   

     c. Deploy Repository manager (DRM)
     
          1. Deploy Dell Repository manager to this share machine. 
          2. Create a repository for the Cluster server Model number . use these shares for the repository location.
          3. EXPORT EXPORT EXPORT the repository to this share into an updates folder. this locaton will have 4 total sub folders
          4. DO NOT download the repostiory it does not work wth OMIMSWAC (catalog created on export)
                (i) path will later be used by OMIMSWAC- Export  to \\Servername\DEllUpdates\updates\hcios21h2_1.00_Catalog.xml


             
     d. Add Paths to OMIMSWAC for Upates to work
     
          (1) Add IC DSU and Updates catalog location paths to the two locations showing in the SCREEN SHOT BELOW
             (i) The Settings ICON will have the IC and DSU File paths- required to be entered. 
             (ii) Once YOu choose the UPDATE tab, choose manual and DRM radio button for the catalog path (updates path)
             
    
    Populate share locations in OMIMSWAC
      
             
   
   
   
	e. Backup - this folder will be used for log collection to a central location (Option #8)
 
  
   

    
   How To Use: 
 Use the URL Below. Put into a powershell window and the files will download into the Downloads Folder. They will unzip and SetupWacInstall will begin. You will 
 see the menu in the above screen shot. You may Test and go over the WAC install. You may perform tests with Menu Item 1-7. :
```Powershell
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12;Invoke-Expression('$module="SetupWacInstall";$repo="PowershellScripts"'+(new-object System.net.webclient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Louisjreeves/SetupWacInstall/main/ExpandAndSetupCORP.ps1'));Invoke-SetupWacInstall
```

===========================
Simple Offline Release Cantidate (SORC) OMIMSWAC
DIFFERENT VERSION OF THE SCRIPT FOR BASIC OFFLINE SETUP

1) Step one. Download the Zip folder called RCSImplePreRequisites.zip (Quit the script and when it asks to put in a cluster name.) Find it in the Downloads folder. 
Use this link then move to step 2:

```Powershell
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12;Invoke-Expression('$module="setupWacInstall";$repo="PowershellScripts"'+(new-object System.net.webclient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Louisjreeves/SetupWacInstall/main/ExpandSImplePreRequisites.ps1'));Invoke-RCSimplePreRequsites
```


 2) Follow steps in the bullets below. This is what you will be focused on- this folder called RCSimplePreRequisites
