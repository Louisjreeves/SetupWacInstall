=========================================================================

THis Script running in the download:
	 1. SHould run from Downloads folder of the logged on admin
	 2. Open Powershell as admin 
	 3. Needs to run on a cluster node unless running option 8 setp 1 installing WAC, then you should not run on a cluster node for this step
	 4. Run the Powershell command below:
 
 
```Powershell
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12;Invoke-Expression('$module="setupWacInstall";$repo="PowershellScripts"'+(new-object System.net.webclient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Louisjreeves/SetupWacInstall/main/ExpandSImplePreRequisites.ps1'));Invoke-RCSimplePreRequsites

## steps to run before Deploying Windows admin center: 
1.	Option 1 Required -  All prerequsites for the product to work. - Run on one Cluster node and WAC machine. Drac tools and fixes.
2.	Option 2 Required - Install ISM module. Run on one node and all nodes are addressed. Run on one node and on the WAC server. ISM module and fixes.
3.	Option 3 Required - Checks Steps one and 2. checks and requirements
4.	Option 4 Required - Checks USBNIC status and IP connectivity. check connectivity
5.      Option 5 Optional - Checks port 445 and 5985 connectivity and verifies ports open.
6.      Option 6 Multi-Menu 

	 1.  Troubleshooting -Repair CLuster Performance History
	 2.  Troubleshooting -Repair CAU Cluster aware update if CAU VCO virtual computer object is already defined and setup. 
	 3.  Troubleshooting -remove USB Drac Network from cluster communication
	 4.  Troubleshooting - Restart all dracs
	 5.  Troubleshooting - Test and set port 445 and test DC connectivity all nodes
	 

7.      Option 7 - Troublehshooting - COllect logs, auto convert to text and save to local share. 
8.      Option 8 Multi-Menu

	 1. Recommended - Windows Admin Center Install

## Prerequisite Instructions to allow OMIMSWAC to work properly

     a. Use cluster manager to deploy CAU. 
     
          1. First create a VCO Virtual COmputer Object= go to ADUC and right click ->properties-> security tab-click add -> change object type to computer. Then                    create a computer account in the same OU as the cluster nodes
          2. Once Created go to the OU above and add the Computer name just created. and add the rights to write computer ojects 
          3. Read/Write computer ojbects, Read/Write child objects, Read and write.
          4. make sure the cluster is also in this OU and has full control over the cluster nodes
          5. reference https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/failover-clustering/prestage-cluster-adds
        
     b. Create a share - not in the cluster or vms on cluster- Not on the WAC server. All nodes need full control to this folder. 
     
          1. Main share \\Servername
          2. DEllUpdates - Folder where all the OMIMSWAC files will be located \\Servername\Folder
          3. DSU - Dell Server Update EXE- Place in this folder - \\Servername\DEllUpdatesDSU\
                   (i) Download DSU from  https://dl.dell.com/omimswac/ 
                   (ii) path will later be used by OMIMSWAC  \\Servername\DEllUpdates\DSU\Systems-Management_Application_5C2CW_WN64_1.9.2.0_A00.EXE
          4. IC Inventory COllector. place in the path created -  \\Servername\DEllUpdates\IC\
                   (i) Download from  Download https://dl.dell.com/omimswac/ 
                   (ii) path will later be used by OMIMSWAC  - \\Servername\DEllUpdates\IC\invcol_8YPK7_WIN64_21_12_200_1196_A00.exe
                   

     c. Deploy Repository manager (DRM)
     
          1. Deploy Dell Repository manager to this share machine. 
          2. Create a repository for the Cluster server Model number . use these shares for the repository location.
          3. ## EXPORT EXPORT EXPORT # # the repository to this share into an updates folder. this locaton will have 4 total sub folders
          4. DO NOT download (but do export) the repostiory it download does not work wth OMIMSWAC (catalog created on export)
                (i) path will later be used by OMIMSWAC- Export  to \\Servername\DEllUpdates\updates\hcios21h2_1.00_Catalog.xml


             
     d. Add Paths to OMIMSWAC for Upates to work
     
          (1) Add IC DSU and Updates catalog location paths to the two locations showing in the SCREEN SHOT BELOW
             (i) The Settings ICON will have the IC and DSU File paths- required to be entered. 
             (ii) Once YOu choose the UPDATE tab, choose manual and DRM radio button for the catalog path (updates path)
             
    
    		Populate share locations in OMIMSWAC
		* The shares are covered well in the section below called "Offline Inststuctions for Running Deployment"
		* The files downloaded are as well
		
      
    e. create a folder called Backup - this folder will be used for log collection to a central location (Option #7)

  	\\Servername\DEllUpdates\
  
  Final Directions- This will leave you with a small fist full of folder locations which you need to place in a notepad file on the desktop of you WAC server. 
  This will afford you the ability to recover from a WAC update quickly. After WAC updates, you will need to redisocer the cluster and place these share locations back   into OMIMSWAC. The backup folder is for the use of this tool. 
  
	  \\Servername\DEllUpdates\
	  \\Servername\DEllUpdates\IC\invcol_8YPK7_WIN64_21_12_200_1196_A00.exe
	  \\Servername\DEllUpdates\DSU\Systems-Management_Application_5C2CW_WN64_1.9.2.0_A00.EXE
	  \\Servername\DEllUpdates\updates\hcios21h2_1.00_Catalog.xml

# # OFfline Instalation and Deployment Instructions

Run the powershell Here  to download, Extract and run: 

```Powershell
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12;Invoke-Expression('$module="setupWacInstall";$repo="PowershellScripts"'+(new-object System.net.webclient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Louisjreeves/SetupWacInstall/main/ExpandSImplePreRequisites.ps1'));Invoke-RCSimplePreRequsites
```
1. The above instructions are also relevent but some additional points: 
2. Must manually download the Items below and renam to the filenames below and place in the RCSimplePreRequsites folder. 
3. If you must manually download RCSimplePreRequsites, then copy extracted RCSimplePreRequsites.zip folder, to the user profile downloads folder. 
4. Follow steps in the bullets below. This is what you will be focused on- this folder called RCSimplePreRequisites
 
 ![Figure 1. Script folder RCSimplePreRequisites](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79279019/169087650-67d497fb-14cb-4c5d-b1dd-833020e2a8f4.png)
 
	*Locate the folder called RCSimplePreRequisites (downloads folder)
	*You will need to copy the two files below into this folder. 
	* Download this file https://downloads.dell.com/FOLDER07549599M/1/DellEMC-iDRACTools-Web-WINX64-10.2.0.0-4583_A00.exe 
	*Rename the file to  racadmininstall.exe and place inside the RCSIMPLEPreRequisites folder. 
	*Download this file : https://downloads.dell.com/FOLDER07508105M/1/OM-iSM-Dell-Web-X64-4.1.0.0-2410_A00.exe 
	*Rename this file to  isminstall.exe and place it into the  RCSIMPLEPreRequisites folder
	*Copy the script folder to a cluster node. 
	*Open PowerShell as administrator and run  .\RcSimplePrerequisites.ps1 , from inside the RCSimplePreRequisites  folder . 

Hit yes every single time an approval pops up, without fail. This is your pre-requisites being applied. 16 nodes is 64 yesâ€™s!


# Note for high security environments. You may have a problem getting started. 
 
1. This script is designed to help with this difficulty. 
2. Before running this scipt make sure you can access the C$ share from each node to each node
3. Make sure you can successfully etsn (enter-psSession) to every node from any other node
4. Login with admin credentials. This tool uses the logged in creds for all actions. 
5. Make sure to run Powershell as administrator.
